REMAINDER:
Calculations of discounted price is done by following python expression:
    discounted_price = price_per_unit * percent_off // 100


Short-comings:
1) Manage Product ->
   Admin jodi kono product insert korar shomoy vul tottho diye insert kore,
   tahole shei vul thik korar upay nai kono
    -> Product insert kore felar pore delete korar option nai
    -> Product info (price per unit, name) edit korar option nai
       (shudhu stock edit kora jay)

2) Sidebar not sticky -> (unsolvable)
        Page scroll kore niche namanor pore reload deya hole sidebar non-sticky
        hoye jay

3) Checkout pagea points redeem korle page auto-refresh hoye jay. Checkout forme
   kono info edit kora thakle refresh er fole shei data chole jay, notun kore input deya lage

4) Creating a new sale on a product that already has an existing sale, might create problems
   in the backend


TODO:
1) Customers should able to see flash sale list.
2) Customers should be able to see discounted price of sale on product list
3) Kumpir should be able to edit any product information
   (Currently, kumpir can only edit stock of product
    Uneditable product information containts name, unit, price per unit, cat and subcat)
4) Bundle offer
	-?? Kumpir should be able to include an item from product lists into bundle offer
	    similar to cart system. And then can create the bundle offer with the products
	    selected, similar to the checkout system of a cart
