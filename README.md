## The journey:
The beginning felt like a maze, with me not knowing how to start, where to go, what to do. I started looking around youtube tutorials trying to 
get the grasp of how to use django. And even before that, creating a user in oracle was a huge hassle overcoming which took me days, only due to the
fact that I was too lazy to work around something new.
